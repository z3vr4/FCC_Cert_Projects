# FCC_Cert_Projects
These are some of the certification projects I've coded on FreeCodeCamp.
## Data Graph Explorer
The code in the Data_Graph_Explorer_v1.py file was meant to be run in Google Colab, but should be able to run normally elsewhere by not using the manual upload function.
Its objective is to take a CSV file and provide some simple graphing options and mathematical analysis of the columns the user chooses.
I intend to fully develop this concept into an API based data analysis tool capable of providing some statistical analysis and predictions of certain types of data, sometime in the future.

## Projectile Trajectory
Originally coded in Google Colab. This code graphs a quadratic equation simulating a (simplified) projectile trajectory in the shape of a parabola and lets the user adjust the variables in real time.
Mre of a code practice exercise to work with interactive graphs than an useful program.

## Old_Budget_App
A project required for the Scientific Computing with Python dev certification. I coded this one long ago, early into my learning journey, so the code might not be as optimized or readable as other examples, but it serves to demonstrate some OOP.

## "Cash Register"
The 5th required certification project on the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course on FreeCodeCamp. Submitted as an example of my coding, although its from back when I was still somewhat new to Javascript.
